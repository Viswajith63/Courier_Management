# Courier_Management
PROPOSED SYSTEM

•	Automated Order Processing: The system automatically processes and assigns orders to available couriers based on predefined rules and criteria.
•	Status Tracking: Managers can track the status and location of deliveries.
•	Proof of Delivery: Couriers capture electronic proof of delivery, such as digital signatures or photos, which are instantly updated in the system.
•	Reporting and Analytics: Comprehensive reports and analytics provide insights into delivery performance, resource utilization, customer satisfaction, and other key metrics.
•	User Management and Authentication: The system provides role-based access control and authentication mechanisms to ensure data security and privacy.
•	Scalability and Customization: The system is designed to accommodate the growing needs of the courier company and can be customized to specific business requirements.
Implementing these features in a Courier Management System would automate and streamline the entire delivery process, resulting in improved efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall operational performance.
Considerations:

The admin of courier agencies are required to create an account first to get access to the database and query result retrieval.
